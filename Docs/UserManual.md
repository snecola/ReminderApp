# User Manual for Reminders

#### Team 3 : Steven Necola

#### The Reminders App allows users to create reminder lists where they can store their reminders. We've included this user manual with instructions and pictures on how to use our application.

##### Note: The final product/application may differ from included mockups.

## Home Page (activity_main)

Upon opening the application, the user is greeted with the homepage that shows their lists underneath the **My Lists** section. If the user has no lists, no lists will be shown. When the user wants to create a list, they can click the **New List** button. They can also create a new reminder by clicking on the **New Reminder** button. If the user wants to see all their reminders for the current day, they can click on the **Today** button. The user is also able to see all their reminders by clicking on the **All** button.

## Creating a list (activity_reminder_newlist)

When a user creates a new list clicking on the **New List** button on the home page, they will be prompted to enter a name for the new list. The user is allowed to cancel their current action and not create a list by clicking the **Cancel** button. If the user happy with the name they provided for the list, they can click the **Add** button and their list will be added on the Home Page.
