## 1 Design Considerations

*The subsections below describe the issues that need to be addressed or resolved prior to or while completing the design, as well as issues that may influence the design process.*

### 1.1 Assumptions

*Describe any assumption, background, or dependencies of the software, its use, the operational environment, or significant project issues.*
We are planning on using Andriod Studio to complete the project. As of now we have no software issues. 

### 1.2 Constraints

*Describe any constraints on the system that have a significant impact on the design of the system.*
The device will need to accommodate location, alert features using Android API Level 21.

### 1.3 System Environment

*Describe the hardware and software that the system must operate in and interact with.*
This application will be available for users who have android smartphones.

## 2 Architectural Design
*The architecture provides the high-level design view of a system and provides a basis for more detailed design work. These subsections describe the top-level components of the system you are building and their relationships.*
